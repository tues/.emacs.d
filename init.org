* About this file

After many years of creating new =init.el= files from scratch on each machine I used (because old
ones somehow weren't portable and were so degenerate I didn't want to fix them) I finally decided
to organise my Emacs configuration properly. This is the result. It is heavily influenced by
[[https://github.com/sachac/.emacs.d/][Sacha Chua's Org mode-based .emacs.d]]. This is also my first foray into literate programming using
[[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]]. Even if not useful to anyone else, I do hope it will help me remember the purpose of each
elisp snippet I add here.

I'm starting by creating an almost empty Org file and keeping my old config as =legacy.el=.
I will slowly move code here over time.

* Load =legacy.el=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (load "~/.emacs.d/legacy.el")
#+end_src
